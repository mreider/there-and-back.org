My focus is with wet plate collodion (tintypes), traditional black and white photography, and commissioned portraiture. She is a member of the [Rolls and Tubes Collective](https://www.instagram.com/rolls_and_tubes/) and acting Board President of the [East Bay Photo Collective](https://www.ebpco.org/).

There's a lot more information about my work at [jennysampson.com](https://jennysampson.com).
