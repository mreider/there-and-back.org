Day 1 

Today is Max's birthday. He's three. Max has a sister-Zoe. She's not so old. Zoe is about one and a half. They live on a steep hill with trees in Oakland, California. Max likes to do stuff on his own and in his own way. He doesn't like it when people pet his hair. His hair is light brown and arranges itself in a curve like a lovable sleeping kitten. He's polite but moves off when people fuss with it. Max says, "I'm going to be a big guy." 

Grownups and big kids at the party try to show him what to do with his new airplane. They say, "See, it flies way up high like this. Whee!" Max says, "I'm going into my room now and take a rest." He comes out a few minutes later bringing with him the two train cars from his bed. They are named Gordon and Emily. Max's Mom and Dad Gordon say and Emily are there for him at bedtime instead of putting Binky in his Travis and Ta mouth. Binkies make teeth grow crooked, his parents explain. 

Max drives Gordon and Emily together over the sharply sloping bridge. "Chug, chug, chug," says Gordon. Emily joins in singing, "I think I can I think I can." Percy, the train engine, waits his turn. 

Zoe likes being at Max's birthday party. While she makes a path in and around all the people they cry, "Hi, Zoe" and smile at her. Except the people her age - they are too busy. Zoe smiles back and nods her head. It is as if she were agreeing with something they just said. Nod, nod goes Zoe's head. Zoe doesn't talk much. She points to a toy teacup on a shelf if that's what she wants. Or she points up in the air if she wants to be picked up. Grownups think it's funny the way she nods her head. They imitate her and nod their heads at her, crying "Yes! Zoe." That makes Zoe nod her head all the more. One grownup shakes her head, "No.‚Äù Zoe shakes her head, "No." They both think that's awfully funny and laugh. Zoe doesn't mind folks messing with her hair. She likes sticking her fingers in the birthday cake and licking them. On the couch after cake and ice cream she finds her fingers and sticks them in her mouth. 

Day 2 

Max likes his Mom and Dad to read him a book about Babar the elephant and his elephant family. That book is complicated. Max listens carefully. He says, "The elephants are going to war." His Mom and Dad don't like to talk about war. But they say, "Right," and go on to the next page. 

Zoe likes Mom and Dad to read her a book that shows animals putting on red hats, blue shirts and green pants - each in the right place. Pants go on legs, of course. But there is a silly bird that always puts clothes on wrong. Each time the bird is mistaken Zoe hears, "Oops!" That makes Zoe laugh a great deal no matter how many times she hears the book. 

Day 3 

It is Sunday. Max and Zoe are at the playground far downhill from their house. Many families with children had the same idea and are there at the playground. There are plenty of toys at the playground because people bring playthings and leave them for everyone to share in the future. Max sits inside a yellow car with a red steering wheel. He drives the car by pushing with his feet. Zoe would like to drive the car. Max doesn't want to give up driving the car. It's one of his favorite toys. Zoe is pulling on the door and frowning. 

"Max, it is Zoe's turn," sounds a voice over by the swings. That's Max's Dad. He sounds serious. Max gets out of the car. Zoe gets in. She can push the car with her feet too. But not as fast. 

Max and a friend he has just met, Lorelai, are swinging high on a rubber tire attached by metal chains to the swing set. Max's Dad and Mom are taking turns pushing the tire in a circle. Lorelai's Dad tells Max's parents that Loralai is two and a half. She is wearing a dress and has blond hair with curls. She likes being with Max.

Max sings. His song is a blend of bits and pieces he has heard many times. Some of what he sings is impossible to understand. Some of the words that made sense were: "And he called it a COW... you can play with my dishes... my country tis... go away... went up the water... goodnight... goodnight... wah wah, wah, wah... the hills are alive... ...a SHEEP.. who who... woo woo... comin' round the bend..." 

"It's like Yiddish," said Lorelai's Dad, who, along with Lorelai's Mom, has just met Max's parents. The playground is in Berkeley, California. In Berkeley you don't have to be Jewish to know Yiddish is a hodgepodge. People trust strangers at playgrounds in Berkeley. Call it the new Lake Wobegone *where all the women are strong, all the men are good looking, all the children are above average* and... all the toys are shared.
