These writings. produced in the last fifteen years, reflect the journey from work as a psychiatrist to retirement. I retired in 2003. I then became a member of the Osher Foundation Lifelong Learning Institute at Brandeis University and the Fromm Institute at the University of San Francisco. I have been trying to expand my ability to play, exploring my role as husband, father and grandparent. I wouldn't say that humor is everything. but it's scary to think of life without it.

Pete wrote this for the back cover of his book Stepping Stones a few years before his death on August 13, 2015.

The stories in his book are available below.
