An elderly Asian servant sweeps the doorstep proteceted by a surgical mask.

Not a particle of the past transcends the warp of that shallow chalice tipped up to the mouth.

The cement for these houses was poureed about 1930.

Nothing substantial - no wine - no wafer - crosses the lip of 83 years.

... no getting ourselves back to the garden.

There is just the sound of Joni Mitchell's voice.

*We are startdust, we are golden.*
